Bluetooth audio playback (A2DP Sink) connector for Windows 10 2004+.

Microsoft added Bluetooth A2DP Sink to Windows 10 2004. However, a third-party app is required to manage connection.\
There is already an app can do this job. However it can't hide to notification area and it's not open-source.\
So I write this app, provide a simple, modern and open-source alternative.
